          <p><em> English Teacher </em></p>
          <p> <strong> Sept. 2013-Present</strong><br>
          I have been teaching children of all levels, from beginner to proficient, since 2013 and I have undertaken
          their preparation for the B1, B2 and C2 level exams. During that period I taught many children with special 
          educational needs and learning difficulties. Since September 2023, I have been working in primary schools 
          teaching children from the 1st to 6th grade.

          I find programming and making apps extremely interesting, and I am familiar with the fundamentals of HTML, 
          CSS and WordPress. Therefore, I am currently developing my own English quiz website, <a href="https://tsiglish.com/">https://tsiglish.com/</a> 
          with the intention of eventually transforming it into a mobile application.</p>
