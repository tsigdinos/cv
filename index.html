          <p> <strong> Sept. 2013-Present</strong><br>I have been teaching children of all levels, from beginner to proficient, since 2013. I have been undertaking their preparation for the ESB (Level 1 Certificate in ESOL International All Modes) B2
            level
            exam and the MSU-CELP (Certificate of English Language Proficiency) C2 level exam. During this time, I have encountered children with special educational needs and learning difficulties. I enjoyed helping these students overcome their
            challenges and with some hard work and persistence, they passed the B2 level exams.</p>
